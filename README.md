# Fernet Encryption & more

2.0 is here and so is many more features and refinements
Check the release changelog for more details

Getting Started:

You will need to install the dependencies you can do this with pip easily for example

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The script is pretty self explanitory and if find any issues please use the issues tab on github and explain what you think seems to be working incorrectly as it will help me to improve the script.

Apart from this I'm sure anyone can figure out how to use the script and in the future I may do a full write up of the usage.

Enjoy.
